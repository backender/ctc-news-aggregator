Untangling Bitcoin Why Russell Yanofsky Is Taking Apart Crypto s Oldest Code CoinDesk, Developers often use words like monolithic blob and tangled to describe the code underpinning bitcoin These words paint a picture of how difficult the code can be to comprehend and in turn work with and it s not exactly a comforting thought for a network supporting 61 billion in investor dollars That s not to say bitcoin doesn t work it does but the state of the codebase does leave something to be desired both for users who might desire more flexibility and the developers who want to improve it So although changes like the code optimization Segregated Witness SegWit and the philosophy of so called hard fork upgrades have attracted the most attention of late several bitcoin developers are working under the radar to untangle bitcoin s messy architecture Chaincode s Russell Yanofsky for one is attempting to tackle one part of the problem with something called process separation in the Bitcoin Core code the most used of the software options Yanofsky told CoinDesk Bitcoin is an older codebase It s changed a lot over time There are lots of parts of it where if we were writing everything from scratch we d probably do things differently But since we have this legacy of code we have to find ways to maintain it Ditch the monolith To begin to understand Yanofksy s process separation technique you must first understand that the Bitcoin Core software is made up of many different pieces and two so called processes that are lumped together in some would argue a random way The first process is called bitcoind and according to Yanofsky is made up of a few things the peer to peer code which connects the nodes in the network the validation code which checks whether transactions and blocks that a node receives are valid and the wallet code which stores a user s private keys The second process bitcoin qt runs all of those things with the addition of a user interface so users with little tech experience can run a full node without using the command line Yanofsky thinks it would be better to separate some of these aspects of the code To that end he s creating a new process bitcoin walletd which splits off the wallet code from bitcoind And he s removing all of the code from bitcon qt except the user interface His slides from a BitDevs presentation in New York City this week show the difference in structure At a high level it may seem as if the various bitcoin processes are already completely separated but in coding terms they aren t So now Yanofsky is essentially building barriers between the different components In this way once the code is finished the wallet portion will not be able to touch other parts of the code Mix and match So what would this mean for users More flexibility mostly Users can move things around like a puzzle mixing and matching the pieces Yanofsky is splitting up For example with the wallet not tied to the node users could take the wallet and use it with any bitcoin node Maybe if you re using an older wallet that doesn t support new features and you don t want to get rid of it or you don t want to transfer your money out the option to bring the wallet over to a different node might be useful he said In much the same way users might want to use the user inteface of bitcoin qt with different bitcoind nodes You could basically have a bitcoin node running on a server someplace Maybe you just want to run the GUI to just check what its bandwidth usage is or its peer to peer connections are Yanofsky said Creating more options for users something bitcoin enthusiasts are particularly attentive to is why Yanofsky is working on the project at all While he admits his changes could slow things down a little or make debugging code more difficult for developers the project has gotten a GitHub blessing from several Bitcoin Core contributors includinglead maintainer Wladimir J van der Laan and contributor Daniel Cousen And that s partly because the advantages aren t only user facing Yanofksy said adding There are user visible features that come out of it but there s also a big architectural and code cleanup component to it Review bottleneck WhileYanofsky said he s almost done writing the code for the major upgrade there s still a number of things need to happen before it can be officially added to Bitcoin Core The biggest problem with review is getting people s attention he said Since a number of open source bitcoin developers have to review each code change before it can be added and there is a limited number of developers with the expertise to review code changes the process could be a long one Yanofsky also expects some other changes such as Cory Fields peer to peer code additions and wallet code changes from his Chaincode colleague Matt Corallo will also take precedence over his process separation change Right now the focus is definitely not in this area Yanofsky said Our biggest priority right now is getting better SegWit support This feature will have to wait its turn But while it s not on the priority list just yet the work still promises to be an important change as highlighted by Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell s comment on the Yanofsky s Github I think we should have done something like this a long time ago 
Vivid History How Money Got Free Is the Untold Story of Bitcoin CoinDesk, An early bitcoin developer and entrepreneur Alex Waters served as COO and CIO for bitcoin exchange startup BitInstant Later going on to start several bitcoin ventures he was also at the forefront of efforts to boost its regulatory compliance In this opinion piece Waters reviews How Money Got Free Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance Oneworld Publications arguing it captures the zeitgeist of the original cryptocurrency and the sprawling all too human movement that helped it reach the masses I have long suspected owing to its sheer brilliance and idiosyncratic beauty that bitcoin was in fact brought here by aliens from another planet Brian Patrick Eha s vivid history of bitcoin How Money Got Free Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance which captures in thrilling journalistic fashion what I experienced in my years working on this remarkable technology only confirms my suspicions I regret not recording what I saw and felt while working on bitcoin the fleeting moments of intense joy and dismay that once seemed too meaningful ever to forget But at the time it was all I could do to keep up with the pace and my life became a blur of 80 hour working weeks devoted to the engineering project of a lifetime As the years passed and the blockchain industry exploded it seemed that these beautiful moments of intellectual adventure would remain only as fading memories slowly dimming as I aged The idea that an author could capture the essence of that stirring time seemed impossible even in my most optimistic moments Yet just as I had initially done with bitcoin I came to find in reading Eha s book that I had underestimated once again From the top Eha starts at the beginning sparing no detail The era he eloquently describes was an alternate reality which brought together the brightest hardest working and most ideologically extreme individuals I have ever known We shared common goals and an outsider camaraderie that only grew stronger as we made progress in the early years of bitcoin s ascendance Looking back it s sobering to realize that some of us were imprisoned or otherwise suffered as a result of the desire to improve and promote this new kind of money For some of my fellow pioneers the intensity of their ideological commitments became a prison in itself Early bitcoiners collectively witnessed the radical dismantling of tribal and national affiliations and the formation in their place of a new global citizenry The birth of bitcoin and its blockchain was an important moment in human history one whose legacy deserves to be documented How Money Got Free is precisely what I was yearning to read The fascinating detail and precise vocabulary of Eha s writing provide a sense of closure for me personally It feels cathartic to now possess a tome which records the visceral thrill of bitcoin s rise the earthshaking import of its innovations As I read I felt as though I were in the room witnessing the breakthroughs made by the first bitcoin pioneers The truth is I have crossed paths with many of the characters depicted in the book Some of them were in close proximity to me for nearly a decade Until now I didn t know why these people had joined the bitcoin community or how fate had guided us to share in this wonderful experiment While I was busy working on cash remittance at BitInstant I had very little insight into what others were working on in parallel The challenges faced by Coinbase Blockchain BitPay SecondMarket and others were just brief news headlines to me at the time like billboards flashing past on the highway I had little appreciation for the depth of their intensity or the richness of the stories behind those headlines all of which is conveyed in full through Eha s narrative Consequently How Money Got Free has changed my perspective on many of those people some of whom I once thought of as competitors What I ve since learned is that we were all in the same boat whatever our individual aims Bitcoin itself is in some sense our parent organization and its furtherance benefits us all Eha interviewed me for his book as he did many of my former colleagues and acquaintances When I asked what had motivated him to write it he said that he wanted to shine a light on the pioneers and preserve the history of bitcoin s formative years His book which is both a work of investigative journalism and a tremendous feat of storytelling focuses mainly on the period from 20092015 though Eha also examines bitcoin s precursors and an epilogue brings his narrative almost to the present day The martyrs explorers creators and pariahs who champion new technologies and advance society Eha told me are often overlooked or soon fall into obscurity While every frontier has to be settled eventually the lessons learned during the rough and tumble days are important so that future projects are inoculated against failure by the hardships of the past Untold stories How Money Got Free transports readers to the meeting rooms startup couches conference halls online discussion boards and proverbial watercoolers where the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry took shape It guides readers through the history of bitcoin s implementation and explains its potential for the future Whether you are a bitcoin believer or a skeptic Eha s work will arm you with a deeper knowledge not only of the technology but of the human motives behind it It is inspiring evocative and imbued with empathy for the dreamers the crazy ones as Eha puts it in the book s dedication echoing Steve Jobs who move society forward As the book makes clear bitcoin would not be where is it today had it not been for all of the people who clicked on a link who read an article who discussed built argued and invested Small in themselves each of these actions shaped our future they contributed to the momentum of where we are going Naturally our past informs our choice of what to write what to click with whom to argue and what to say Just so early bitcoiners tended to have philosophical or political reasons for being drawn to cryptocurrency and Eha is splendid at delving into primary sources and tracing the wellsprings of these convictions As we express ourselves through the use of these new technologies the Internet email text messaging social networks blockchains we stand to benefit from weighing the long term implications of even our smallest interactions It is crucial for us to recognize and reflect on the journeys made and efforts undertaken to bring us our current way of life But while some figures loom larger than others every person who participates in bitcoin even conceptually is taking an implied risk It carries social legal and financial consequences regardless of success That risk and the willingness to take it in the interest of furthering humanity is what binds us together Eha s book reminds me of something Faulkner once wrote The past is never dead It s not even past Even now it informs our actions and we need to understand it if we want to understand where we are going How Money Got Free conveys the essence of bitcoin s past not preserved in amber but alive with color and controversy For non geeks reading this book may be the first step toward acceptance of our inevitable future It can serve as a permanent record for those who weren t around to witness the events first hand and as an inspiration for all the dreamers still captivated by a transcendence which rivals the internet itself
